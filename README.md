<h2 id="video-frame-extraction-and-feature-tracking-using-opencv">1. Video Frame Extraction and Feature Tracking using OpenCV</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this project, we explore the use of the OpenCV library in Python to process a video file. OpenCV is a versatile tool for computer vision applications, allowing us to perform various operations on images and videos.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Read a video file as input:</strong> Load and process the video file using OpenCV's video capture functionality.</li>
    <li><strong>Extract frames from the video:</strong> Split the video into individual frames for further processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Feature tracking:</strong> Implement feature tracking across frames using algorithms like Optical Flow.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="applying-a-bilateral-filter-to-an-image-using-python">2. Applying a Bilateral Filter to an Image Using Python</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>This project demonstrates how to apply a bilateral filter to an image using Python and OpenCV. The bilateral filter is used for edge-preserving smoothing, which is particularly useful in reducing noise while keeping edges sharp.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Load an image:</strong> Use OpenCV to load an image from a file.</li>
    <li><strong>Apply a bilateral filter:</strong> Implement the bilateral filter to smooth the image while preserving edges.</li>
    <li><strong>Compare results:</strong> Evaluate the effectiveness of the bilateral filter compared to other smoothing techniques.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="image-processing-with-closing-and-opening-operations">3. Image Processing with Closing and Opening Operations</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>In this project, we focus on morphological operations like closing and opening, which are essential for removing noise and small objects from an image. These operations are frequently used in image preprocessing steps.</p>

<h3>Objectives</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Load an image:</strong> Use OpenCV to load an image for processing.</li>
    <li><strong>Apply morphological operations:</strong> Implement closing and opening operations using OpenCV.</li>
    <li><strong>Analyze the results:</strong> Assess how these operations affect the image quality, particularly in noise reduction and object separation.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>
<p>To run these projects, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the following libraries:</p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://opencv.org/" target="_blank">OpenCV</a></li>
    <li><a href="https://numpy.org/" target="_blank">NumPy</a></li>
</ul>
<p>You can install these libraries using pip:</p>
<pre><code>pip install opencv-python numpy</code></pre>

<h3>Running the Projects</h3>
<p>Each project is contained in its own directory within this repository. You can run the scripts directly using Python:</p>
<pre><code>python project_name.py</code></pre>
<p>Replace <code>project_name.py</code> with the actual script name you want to execute.</p>
